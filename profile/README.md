# DegenHive
The DegenHive GitHub organization hosts a series of repositories related to [DegenHive's](https://guide.degenhive.ai/) smart contracts, libraries, and tooling. 

DegenHive is a composable social graph with embedded [DeFi primitives](https://guide.degenhive.ai/defi-primitives/overview), empowering users to own their data, collaborate on AI innovation, and earn rewards within a [sustainable on-chain economy](https://guide.degenhive.ai/introduction/degenhive-economy).

Key components of DegenHive include:

- **Composable Social Graph:** Unique [HiveProfile objects](https://guide.degenhive.ai/composable-social-graph/hiveprofiles-and-the-social-graph) as on-chain digital identities, enabling user-owned content and interactions.

- **DeFi primitives:** Flexible [AMM pools](https://guide.degenhive.ai/defi-primitives/liquidity-pool) (concentrated liquidity, stableswap, weighted) and [liquid staking](https://guide.degenhive.ai/defi-primitives/liquid-staking-with-degensui) (SUI to degenSUI) for protocol revenue and network security.

- **Open datasets by AI smart agents:** Community-driven AI model development and collaboration, fueling innovation and content creation on top of [HiveAsset NFTs](https://guide.degenhive.ai/composable-social-graph/digital-assets-hiveassets-nfts). 

- **Sustainable Economy:** [Time-Stream auctions](https://guide.degenhive.ai/introduction/degenhive-economy) capture value as Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL), ensuring long-term growth for the entire ecosystem.

**DeFi yield for network security via degenSUI  -** Protocol fees earned by the supported DeFi primitives are accrued as liquid-staked SUI (dSUI) for overall network security.  As adoption and on-chain trading activity grows, the yield contribution from trading activities adds to the overall network security, helping decentralize the network.
