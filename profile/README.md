# DegenHive
The DegenHive GitHub organization hosts a series of repositories related to DegenHive's smart contracts, libraries, and tooling.

DegenHive is a composable social graph with embedded DeFi primitives, empowering users to own their data, collaborate on AI innovation, and earn rewards within a sustainable on-chain economy.

Key components of DegenHive include:

- **Composable Social Graph:** Unique HiveProfile objects as on-chain digital identities, enabling user-owned content and interactions.

- **DeFi primitives:** Flexible AMM pools (concentrated liquidity, stableswap, weighted) and liquid staking (SUI to degenSUI) for protocol revenue and network security.

- **Open datasets by AI smart agents:** Community-driven AI model development and data, fueling innovation and content creation.

- **Sustainable Economy:** Time-Stream auctions capture value as Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL), ensuring long-term growth for the entire ecosystem.

**DeFi yield for network security via degenSUI  -** Protocol fees earned by the supported DeFi primitives are accrued as liquid-staked SUI (dSUI) for overall network security.  As adoption and on-chain trading activity grows, the yield contribution from trading activities adds to the overall network security, helping decentralize the network.
