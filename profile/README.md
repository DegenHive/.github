# DegenHive
Welcome to the DegenHive GitHub organization! This is the home for all repositories related to DegenHive—featuring smart contracts, libraries, and tooling for our innovative DeFi x P2E ecosystem.

DegenHive merges gaming and decentralized finance through a **gamified meta-DEX and liquid staking protocol.** 

Players collect, breed, and evolve digital bees into more powerful forms—culminating in epic battles, strategic gameplay, and on-chain governance. 

These unique bee characters grow stronger through battles, quests, and evolution stages, unlocking powerful abilities as they transform. The gameplay is designed to incentivize engagement while enabling players to earn rewards through the protocol’s liquid staking mechanics.
