# DegenHive
The DegenHive GitHub organization hosts a series of repositories related to [DegenHive's](https://guide.degenhive.ai/) smart contracts, libraries, and tooling. 

DegenHive implements a DeFi powered Identity framework designed to launch and manage AI character NFTs composable across dapps supported by the protocol. 

Key components of DegenHive include:

- **Identity Framework:** Every unique user on DegenHive is represented by a HiveProfile object, which enables user to participate in governance and earn protocol yield on DegenHive. HiveProfile objects come with inbuilt-support for storing and trading HiveAsset NFTs, which can represent ownership of AI characters, assets, and other digital content on the platform. 

- **DeFi primitives:** Flexible [AMM pools](https://guide.degenhive.ai/defi-primitives/liquidity-pool) (concentrated liquidity, stableswap, weighted) and [liquid staking](https://guide.degenhive.ai/defi-primitives/liquid-staking-with-degensui) (SUI to degenSUI) for protocol revenue and network security.

- **The dApp Store:** DegenHive's dApp store will be the first fully on-chain framework available to developers to launch and compose their dapps seamlessly with dynamic NFTs composable with every dapp available on the framework. 

- **Sustainable Economy:** [Honey-Stream auctions](https://guide.degenhive.ai/the-degenhive-economy/honey-streams) capture value as Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL), ensuring long-term growth for the entire ecosystem.

**DeFi yield for network security via degenSUI  -** Protocol fees earned by the supported DeFi primitives are accrued as liquid-staked SUI (dSUI) for overall network security.  As adoption and on-chain trading activity grows, the yield contribution from trading activities adds to the overall network security, helping decentralize the network.
